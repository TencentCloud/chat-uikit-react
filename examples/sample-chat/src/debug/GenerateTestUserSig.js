/**
 * Module: GenerateTestUserSig
 *
 * Description: Generates UserSig for testing. UserSig is a security signature designed by Tencent Cloud for its cloud services.
 * It is calculated based on `SDKAppID`, `UserID`, and `EXPIRETIME` using the HMAC-SHA256 encryption algorithm.
 *
 * Attention: For the following reasons, do not use the code below in your commercial application.
 *
 * The code may be able to calculate UserSig correctly, but it is only for quick testing of the SDKâ€™s basic features, not for commercial applications.
 * `SECRETKEY` in client code can be easily decompiled and reversed, especially on web.
 * Once your key is disclosed, attackers will be able to steal your Tencent Cloud traffic.
 *
 * The correct method is to deploy the `UserSig` calculation code and encryption key on your project server so that your application can request from your server a `UserSig` that is calculated whenever one is needed.
 * Given that it is more difficult to hack a server than a client application, server-end calculation can better protect your key.
 *
 * Reference: https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/17275#Server
